# ISO acceptance tests

Run the complete release test from the repository root:

```bash
make test
```

There is one test result. The command first verifies the framework, then boots
the newest ISO in `dist/`, performs every supported installation, and runs every
desktop suite. Exit code zero means every declared check ran and passed. A
failure, interruption, missing prerequisite, unavailable public service, or
unexecuted check means the ISO is not approved for release.

Pass `ISO=/path/to/image.iso` and `ARCH=amd64|arm64` only when the newest image
cannot be selected automatically. `TEST_ARGS=--no-tui` switches to persistent
plain output without changing which tests run.

The acceptance Live region is the ISO's first entry, i.e. the default region
of the manifest the image was built from (`defaults.live_region: iso-default`).
Cases and suites that declare `requires_locales` run only when the ISO carries
those regions; the runner prints each skipped item with its reason. Desktop
suites additionally need guest UI labels for the session language
(`assertions/guest/ui/core.py`, English and Chinese today).

The JSON files under `cases/` are the complete executable inventory. Adding a
declared desktop check without an implementation is a unit-test failure. The
runner also fails unless every selected installation and suite produces a
verdict.

The installation matrix boots temporary Live overlays on the original
read-only ISO. One amd64/arm64 scenario additionally boots a writable hybrid
copy through the real Dracut persistent menu entry, writes a sentinel, powers
off, and boots the same media again before installation. Persistence is not
credited from GRUB text inspection alone.

## Results

Each run writes a new directory under `test-results/` containing `summary.json`,
`junit.xml`, screenshots, serial logs, installer output, journal evidence, and
per-check diagnostics. Disposable virtual disks and overlays are deleted after
the run, including the expanded writable Live-media copy and including after
interruption. Keep the result directory when filing a failure; its evidence
identifies whether the product, host prerequisites, or an external service
caused the failure.

Before a new matrix starts, `make test` also reclaims disposable disks orphaned
by an uncatchable `SIGKILL`, power loss, or host reboot. A kernel-backed lease
prevents cleanup while another acceptance run is active. The scanner removes
only the exact `target.qcow2`, `overlay.qcow2`, and `live-media.raw` paths from
user-owned result directories; it preserves logs, screenshots, structured
evidence, explicit single-case debug disks, foreign-owned paths, and symlinks.

Run the same cleanup without starting QEMU through the singular test entrypoint:

```bash
python3 tests/run.py clean-disks
```

Preview the reclaimable allocation without changing files with:

```bash
python3 tests/run.py clean-disks --dry-run
```
