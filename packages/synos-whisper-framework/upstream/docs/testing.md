# Voice typing tests

Run commands below from the repository root. Tests use licensed public fixtures
and synthetic noise, never a microphone or private dictation.

## Profiles

Run from the package directory with the local or published Apkg CLI that supports
`TestCommand`. CI selects only `synos-package-release-test`.

| Package/profile | Coverage and prerequisites |
| --- | --- |
| Framework / `synos-package-release-test` | Source behavior, synthetic audio/DSP, and real private-D-Bus diagnostics; Python GI, GStreamer base/good/bad, gettext and D-Bus |
| GTK / `synos-package-release-test` | Settings/controller behavior and Shell isolation guards; Python GI, Node and gettext |
| GTK / `gui` | Real widgets with temporary schemas, memory settings and Xvfb; GTK/Adwaita, Xvfb, xauth and D-Bus |
| Framework / `voice-native` | Native resident worker and VAD with public audio and explicitly supplied models |
| Framework / `voice-cpu` | Corpus accuracy comparisons, resident stress, capture/noise and long VAD replay; native fixtures plus whisper-cli |
| GTK / `desktop-voice` | Real headless GNOME Shell, source extension, native recognition and GTK insertion; usable rendering and native fixtures |

No profile generates, extracts or installs a deb. Required missing tools or
fixtures fail the selected entry. GUI/model tests excluded by profile are not
reported as successful coverage by the release lane.

For native profiles, build the worker from source for the test host and prepare
licensed model fixtures first. Supply absolute paths:

```sh
export SYNOS_VOICE_WORKER=/absolute/source-build/synos-whisper-worker
export SYNOS_VOICE_MODEL=/absolute/fixtures/ggml-base.bin
export SYNOS_VAD_MODEL=/absolute/fixtures/ggml-silero-v6.2.0.bin
export SYNOS_VOICE_SAMPLE=/absolute/source/synos-whisper-framework/data/benchmark/en-short.wav
apkg test --profile voice-native
apkg test --profile voice-cpu
```

Preserve any private library layout required by the source-built worker.
Profiles do not silently build another architecture or download models. The CPU
entry tests this package only; it does not copy other packages or repeat their
release/GUI suites. CPU reports go to the ignored `obj/voice-test-results/`
directory. These benchmarks require an idle machine and do not certify GPU
inference or remote runner provisioning.

## Focused benchmarks

Tools are in `synos-whisper-framework/tests/benchmarks/`. Run each with
`--help` for model, worker and backend options.

| Tool | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `benchmark-corpus.py` | Resident CPU errors must not exceed matching CPU CLI errors. `--gpu` additionally requires actual GPU inference. |
| `benchmark-selected.py` | Test measured automatic selection across auto/English/Chinese, comparing actual backend and accuracy with CPU CLI. |
| `benchmark-capture.py` | Real DSP, native streaming VAD and phrase completion. Use `--normalize-dbfs -26` for the CI input levels. |
| `benchmark-noise.py` | Hum, fan-like and tapping noise at three levels, DSP off/on; reject false triggers. |
| `stress-resident.py` | Stable repeated output/processes, bounded RSS growth, descriptor/thread counts, cancellation and cleanup. |
| `stress-vad.py` | Deterministic replay, resource bounds and cleanup across two simulated 16-minute streams. |

`benchmark_engine.py` is the CLI reference adapter shared by these tests,
not a production inference backend. Do not run timing benchmarks concurrently
with builds or other heavy benchmarks.

### Interpretation and limits

- Raw ASR accuracy is a strict gate. Capture's exit status gates phrase
  completion only; inspect its separate `accuracy_nonregression` and error
  counts. Some Chinese cases regress after frontend processing; passing
  endpoint tests is not proof of accuracy nonregression.
- GPU detection or a GPU request falling back to CPU is not hardware coverage.
  Output-changing candidates must be rejected by automatic selection. Raw GPU
  accuracy and selected-policy accuracy are distinct checks.
- Endpoint timing starts at the last VAD-positive frame, not a ground-truth
  human speech boundary. Inference wall time is measured separately.
- Host RSS does not measure VRAM. Faster-than-real-time VAD replays are not
  wall-clock soak tests. Noise shapes are synthetic, not environmental
  recordings; competing speakers require separate real-world evaluation.
- Workstation results do not certify Lunar Lake or other laptop CPUs/drivers.
  Keep model and decoding quality constant when comparing configurations.

## Desktop integration

```sh
apkg test --path synos-whisper-gtk --profile desktop-voice
```

Requires GNOME Shell with headless Wayland support and usable rendering.
Supply the native artifact/model environment variables above. The test loads
the extension and Python modules directly from source. It
uses a private bus, virtual monitor, temporary settings/cache/runtime and public
audio in place of capture. It never replaces the current Shell or opens a mic.
Recognition, authorization, clipboard/keyboard dispatch and GTK reception are
real. Temporary desktop state is cleaned up after execution. Finish must retain
the final result; Dismiss must prevent late insertion.
Passing does not validate every desktop application or physical microphone.

## Laptop timing report

1. Keep the model/language/microphone fixed and turn live preview off. Let
   initial calibration/preparation finish, then speak a short sentence.
2. Repeat twice in the same session to compare warm requests. Note whether the
   delay is before Listening, after speech ends, or after Recognizing finishes.
3. Before closing the service, export from Settings → Performance diagnostics,
   or run `synos-voice-diagnostics`. Reports are bounded and memory-only;
   exporting does not start a stopped service.
4. If needed, repeat with manual CPU and export separately. Preserve the other
   settings; restore Automatic afterwards. Test live preview separately.

Include package versions, selected model/language/backend and cold/warm context.
No recording or transcript is needed. Missing desktop delivery acknowledgement
does not imply zero insertion latency.
