# Installer localization

The installer presents 28 official language and region choices. American
English (`en_US`) is the source language; the other 27 choices have GNU
gettext catalogs under `po/`.

`data/languages.json` is the installer-owned regional policy source. Each
entry binds a language choice to its locale, representative timezone, default
physical XKB layout and optional input-method policy. The document also owns
the default language, locale aliases and the complete keyboard-layout chooser.
Input-method definitions declare the user-visible product and native-language
names, an optional desktop input source, packages, required target paths and
any user-default files to deploy. The executor does not know the names of Rime,
Mozc, Cangjie, Chewing, Hangul, IBus or any particular language. The installer
never reads or modifies
`/usr/share/language-selector/data/pkg_depends`.

The gettext domain is `synos-installer-beta`. UI code translates against
the language selected inside the installer instead of the process-global
locale, because users can change language on the welcome page without
restarting the application.

`compile-locales.sh` is both the catalog compiler and a release gate. It
rejects a language matrix that differs from the list above, untranslated
entries, invalid format placeholders, and catalogs that cannot be compiled.
APKG runs it before packaging and installs the generated catalogs below
`/usr/share/locale`.

The maintained ordered recommendations are Rime then Wubi for Simplified
Chinese; Cangjie Big, Quick Classic then Cangjie 5 for Hong Kong Traditional
Chinese; Chewing then LibZhuyin for Taiwan Traditional Chinese; ITRANS then
InScript 2 for Hindi; Mozc for Japanese; Hangul for Korean; LibThai for Thai;
and Unikey for Vietnamese. The first item is checked by default, while the UI
allows any number of maintained methods, including none. All boxes are
unchecked and disabled while offline, symmetrically with system updates and
online driver discovery; reconnecting restores the user's remembered choices.
Languages whose JSON entry has no recommendation do not show the extra choice.

Before creating the account, the privileged installer configures the physical
keyboard offline, installs the selected language's exact Ubuntu base and GNOME
language packs, and handles every selected input method independently. It
reuses complete payloads already present on the installation medium. Offline
or download failure is a visible warning and does not abort installation.
The input-method progress row is independent from the physical keyboard and
language-pack rows. It is explicitly skipped when the selected language needs
no additional method or the user leaves every optional method unselected.
Desktop-source registration is generated generically from JSON. Input-method
packages own their shared defaults, so the installer never writes product
configuration to `/etc/skel` or an existing user's home. Adding a language,
layout, locale alias, language-pack code or input method is a data-only change
to `data/languages.json` (plus the normal gettext catalog when translating the
installer UI into a new language).

Raw command output remains unchanged in the Output view so that copied logs
match command-line diagnostics and can be searched reliably. Installer-owned
page text, decisions, warnings, progress labels, and completion instructions
are localized.
