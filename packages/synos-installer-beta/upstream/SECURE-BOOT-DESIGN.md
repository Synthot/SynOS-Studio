# SynOS installer Secure Boot design

## Scope

Release one preserves Secure Boot on amd64 and arm64 UEFI systems. Legacy BIOS
has no Secure Boot state. Secure Boot support is a release blocker, not an
optional best-effort feature.

The implementation follows Ubuntu's Ubiquity/shim workflow:

- detect Secure Boot from the running firmware;
- generate a local MOK with `update-secureboot-policy --new-key`;
- install signed shim and signed GRUB;
- configure DKMS to use the same key;
- queue the certificate with `mokutil --import`;
- show MOKManager on reboot for physical-presence confirmation.

SynOS uses the documented one-time enrollment password `123456`.

## Differences from Ubiquity

Ubiquity generates a key in the live environment, queues it, and later copies
the MOK directory into `/target` without overwriting existing files.

The SynOS installer instead:

1. Copies the target filesystem.
2. Rejects any unmarked key pair inherited from the squashfs.
3. Generates a machine-local key directly inside the target.
4. Records the certificate digest so an interrupted installation reuses the
   same key rather than generating another pending enrollment.
5. Configures DKMS and rebuilds third-party modules.
6. Generates initramfs and installs signed boot artifacts.
7. Verifies every signed EFI executable.
8. Only then mutates firmware state by scheduling MOK enrollment.

This ordering prevents an incomplete installation from requesting trust for a
key whose target system or boot chain was never completed.

## State machine

```text
Secure Boot disabled, unsupported by UEFI firmware, or Legacy BIOS
        |
        +-- no key generation, no MOK mutation

Secure Boot enabled
        |
        +-- verify shim-signed, signed GRUB, mokutil and OpenSSL payloads
        |
        +-- reuse installer-marked key, otherwise discard inherited key
        |
        +-- generate MOK.priv (0600) and MOK.der (0644)
        |
        +-- verify certificate public key matches private key
        |
        +-- write explicit DKMS signing configuration
        |
        +-- when DKMS is installed, build its registered modules against
        |   /target's own installed kernel(s) (not the live session's);
        |   a module that fails to build is logged and skipped, never fatal
        |
        +-- update initramfs
        |
        +-- grub-install --uefi-secure-boot
        |
        +-- verify the signed SynOS vendor EFI chain
        |
        +-- if already enrolled: complete
        |
        +-- if the same certificate is pending: do not import again
        |
        +-- otherwise mokutil --import via stdin password
        |
        +-- mokutil --timeout -1
```

`mokutil --sb-state` is parsed in the C locale. `SecureBoot enabled`,
`SecureBoot disabled`, and `This system doesn't support Secure Boot` are three
distinct explicit outcomes. Missing, malformed, or contradictory output is
indeterminate and stops the plan before destructive work.

Enrollment and pending state use an exact SHA-1 fingerprint match against the
full `mokutil --list-enrolled` and `--list-new` output, preserving all 40 hex
digits including leading zeroes. The installer must not
treat `mokutil --test-key` as a boolean exit status: upstream 0.7.2 returns
zero for an unenrolled key and one for an already enrolled key, while some
distributions patch that convention.

## Secret handling

The MOK enrollment password is executor policy and never appears in
`InstallPlan`. It is passed only through stdin and is absent from argv and
command logs.

`MOK.priv` remains inside the installed system with mode `0600`. It is required
for future DKMS module signing. The certificate is public and uses mode `0644`.

The private key must never be copied from the ISO build environment. A marker
containing the generated certificate's SHA-256 digest distinguishes an
installer-created target key from squashfs residue and makes retries
idempotent.

## DKMS

The installer writes:

```text
/etc/dkms/framework.conf.d/synos-sb-sign.conf
```

with:

```text
mok_signing_key="/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.priv"
mok_certificate="/var/lib/shim-signed/mok/MOK.der"
```

This matches SynOS OOBE policy and avoids relying on DKMS's unreliable
implicit key discovery. The following initramfs rebuild includes whatever
modules DKMS actually managed to build.

### Building against the target's kernel, not the live session's

`dkms autoinstall` with no `-k` builds against `uname -r` of the process
running it. Running it as `chroot /target dkms autoinstall` does not change
that: chroot replaces the filesystem root a process sees, not what the
kernel reports about itself, so an unqualified `dkms autoinstall` inside the
chroot still asks to build for the *live session's* kernel — a version
`/target` was never given headers for, because that is not the kernel being
installed. This looked like "DKMS module build failed" but was really
"there was nothing to build against for that kernel version at all."

`VerifyDkmsSignaturesStep` instead:

1. Reads the kernel version(s) actually installed in `/target` from
   `/target/lib/modules/*`.
2. For each one with any module registered (`dkms status -k <version>`),
   confirms `/target/lib/modules/<version>/build` exists — the same check
   DKMS itself needs to satisfy before it can build anything — before
   calling `dkms autoinstall -k <version>`.
3. If headers for that kernel are missing, it says so in the installer log
   in words ("kernel headers for `<version>` are not installed; no
   out-of-tree modules can be built") and moves on without attempting a
   build that cannot succeed.

### An optional driver never blocks the installation

A package that installs DKMS (a third-party driver such as the Xbox
controller driver) is not required to boot the system it is being added to.
`dkms status -k <version>` is compared before and after `dkms autoinstall`;
any module that does not reach `installed` is recorded — module, version,
kernel and the tail of its DKMS build log
(`/var/lib/dkms/<module>/<version>/.../make.log`) — into the installer's own
log and into the step's result, and the step reports as a **warning**, not a
failure. The installation continues.

This is deliberately different from `PrepareSecureBootStep` and
`EnrollSecureBootStep`, which stay fatal: a build failure in an optional
out-of-tree driver is not a Secure Boot problem. The one case that stays
fatal here is `VerifyDkmsSignaturesStep.verify()`: any module that *did* get
built and installed under `/target/lib/modules/*/updates/dkms/` must be
signed by this installation's own MOK. A module that never built is not
checked (there is nothing under that path to check); a module that built but
carries the wrong — or no — signature is a genuine Secure Boot violation and
still fails the plan.

## Signed EFI artifacts

amd64 requires signed:

- `EFI/SynOS/shimx64.efi`;
- `EFI/SynOS/grubx64.efi`.

arm64 requires signed:

- `EFI/SynOS/shimaa64.efi`;
- `EFI/SynOS/grubaa64.efi`.

Each file is checked with `sbverify`. The PE machine field is also checked by
the bootloader verifier to prevent an amd64/arm64 mismatch.

UEFI installations do not require or validate `EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI` or
`EFI/BOOT/BOOTAA64.EFI`. They use the vendor path and an explicitly verified
SynOS NVRAM entry, so requiring the shared removable-media path would
reintroduce the shim fallback registration dependency avoided by #422.

When an amd64 erase-disk installation is launched through Legacy BIOS, the
installer still writes a removable-media EFI path so the resulting disk can
also boot on UEFI machines without relying on NVRAM services that were not
available during installation. That BIOS portability path is separate from
the Secure Boot MOK enrollment chain described here.

## Future coexistence and redundant boot targets

Guided coexistence may reuse an existing ESP but never formats it. On a shared
ESP the installer:

- writes only the `EFI/SynOS` vendor directory;
- never deletes or renames another vendor's files;
- does not replace `EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI` or
  `EFI/BOOT/BOOTAA64.EFI`;
- creates and verifies an SynOS UEFI NVRAM entry;
- fails with recovery instructions when NVRAM cannot be updated safely rather
  than taking ownership of the shared fallback path.

An existing ESP is accepted only after its identity, FAT filesystem, health
and free-space reserve are validated and bound into the immutable plan.

RAID and other redundant-root layouts require an ESP on every independently
bootable physical disk. Every ESP receives an architecture-matched signed
SynOS chain, and future kernel/initramfs/GRUB or UKI transactions update and
verify all copies before completion. A redundant-root milestone does not pass
until removal of each member in turn still reaches a verified boot chain.

These modes are not part of release one. Their storage identities, write-set
confirmation and delivery sequence are defined in
[`STORAGE-ROADMAP.md`](STORAGE-ROADMAP.md).

## Enrollment and recovery

MOK enrollment is a two-phase operation:

1. The installer writes a pending request to UEFI variables.
2. On reboot, shim's MOKManager requires physical confirmation and password
   `123456`.

The installer must clearly tell the user to select:

```text
Enroll MOK -> Continue -> Yes
```

and enter `123456`.

The installer does not call `mokutil --revoke-import` during cleanup because
that command can affect unrelated enrollment requests already owned by the
user. Enrollment is deliberately scheduled only after all boot-chain checks
pass.

## Required packages

- `shim-signed`
- `mokutil`
- architecture-matched `grub-efi-*-signed`
- architecture-matched `grub-efi-*-bin`
- `openssl`
- `sbsigntool`

amd64 additionally retains `grub-pc-bin` for Legacy BIOS support.

## Release validation

Unit tests cover ordering, password secrecy, key replacement, key-pair
matching, retry idempotency, signed-chain rejection and architecture
selection. `tests/unit/test_secure_boot_dkms.py` covers
`VerifyDkmsSignaturesStep` specifically: building against the target's own
kernel version rather than the live session's, a missing-headers module
being reported and skipped rather than failing the install, a module that
fails to build being reported with its build log tail and also not failing
the install, and a module that built but is signed by the wrong key still
failing `verify()` fatally. None of those tests invoke a real `dkms`,
`chroot` or `openssl`. `tests/unit/test_control_dependencies.py`'s
`DkmsHeadersDependencyTests` separately guards every `packages/*/control`
file: any package that depends on `dkms` must also depend on the kernel
headers matching its base's kernel package, so a future package cannot
reintroduce a DKMS driver with nothing to build against by construction.
Release still requires real UEFI tests for:

- amd64 Secure Boot enabled;
- arm64 Secure Boot enabled;
- enrollment completion in MOKManager;
- boot before and after enrollment;
- DKMS module loading after enrollment;
- a real DKMS driver package (e.g. the Xbox controller driver) installing
  cleanly and continuing the installation on a target with no matching
  kernel headers available;
- canceled or mistyped MOKManager password;
- firmware that rejects EFI-variable writes;
- interrupted installation before and after enrollment scheduling.
- coexistence without changing pre-existing ESP files or fallback loaders;
- multi-ESP synchronization and member-loss boot after RAID support exists.
